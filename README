Work to be done next week:
	Need to figure out how to setContentView to a certain fragment layout depending on what
		junction type image is selected (using Extra and intent).
		This is where I am at the moment:

		imageView.setImageResource(intent.getIntExtra(JntTypeSelectFragment.EXTRA_RES_ID, 0));
		if(???==0)
    			setContentView(R.layout.frag_t_junct);

		if(???==1)
			setContentView(R.layout.frag_cross_junct);

		if(???==2)
			setContentView(R.layout.frag_cross_junct);
		else
			setContentView(R.layout.testing_fragment);
